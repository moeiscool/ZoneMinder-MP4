# What is CCTV? What is Open Source?
CCTV stands for Closed-Circuit Television. It's also a fancy way of saying DVR, Digital Video Recorder. It's a system in which multiple cameras can be watched or recorded for either personal or business circumstances.

Open Source means it is open for editing to your liking... and the way its being made. It will not be difficult. There are no arbitrary libraries, like mootools, to get in your way. Be aware that open source does not mean free. Shinobi just happens to be free as well.

# What is the aim of Shinobi
Shinobi can be used as a Baby Monitor, Construction Site Montage Viewer, Store Camera DVR, and much more. I suppose the simplest way of saying it is *As Magento is to eCommerce, Shinobi is to CCTV.*
